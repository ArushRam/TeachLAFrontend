## Version v2.0.0 | View-only mode, major editor refactoring, and bug fixes (14/05/2020)

This release brings a brand new view-only mode to the editor along with some great refactoring thanks to the absolute titan of a PR that is #219 thanks to the combined efforts of @jamieliu386, @malsf21, and @emmyc. Due to the significant changes to many of the editor's major components in this release, I am marking it as a major release.

Of course, with new features comes new bugs, one of which was found and solved in #245. #274 also fixed a long standing mixup deep in one of our files.

Next up:

- A share button for sketches
- Forking of sketches
- Classes (see [`make-class-page`](https://github.com/uclaacm/TeachLAFrontend/tree/make-class-page))
- Swapping to the Go backend (see [`go-requests`](https://github.com/uclaacm/TeachLAFrontend/tree/go-requests) and #235)

Happy new year! This is a quick snapshot of our app at 01/01/20 (wow). The diff from `1.0.0` is just dependency updates. Until I investigate a way to auto-generate these (probably using `gren`, but that didn't work), I'll type them up manually.

## Version 1.0.0 | The Start of Semver (kinda)! (16/12/2019)

Hey there,

This release marks a milestone - the (almost) end of product development for the decade (wow!), and also the official release of our website on the `editor.uclaacm.com` subdomain (with light mode and everything!). It also marks a milestone for our project's maturity; from this point on, we'll adhere to a slightly modified version of semver, where we'll tag releases with bug fixes (patches), new features (minor releases), and changes that dramatically change the structure of our app or involve a changed API (major releases).

Usually, we'll release a PR-based changelog of the diff from the previous version, but in our case that doesn't really make sense for our first release. As we make more releases, we'll add more detail to what's changed!

Keep tuned for more info! Happy holidays, and have a great new year 😄!
